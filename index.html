      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The A/B Testing assignment involved using a website version A,
          modifying some parts of it in a version B to make improvements to the
          user flow, and then having participants test both version A and B to
          generate data about whether the changes made to B were successful.
          Given metrics like number of misclicks made, time spent on page, and
          amount of mouse movement, we could then analyze the data with various
          statistical analyses to see whether version B truly performed better
          in terms of allowing users to misclick less often and thus spend less
          time on the page and move their cursor around less.

      <h1><sup>01</sup> Changing the Webpage</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          After using version A, I decided to restructure the page content so it
          would hopefully be easier to get a sense of the visual hierarchy with
          a more diverse set of font sizes and colors. Additionally, I also
          changed the color coding of the buttons to draw the users' eyes to the
          "Schedule Appointment" button, which is the one that the task required
          them to click.

      <h1><sup>02</sup> Metric of Choice</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In addition to two assigned metrics (time spent on page and whether
          the user misclicked while trying to accomplish the task) to analyze
          for our A/B testing, I chose mouse movement as my third, since it can
          indicate where the user might be scanning or how confused they might
          be depending on how much they move their mouse around on the page.

      <h1><sup>03</sup> Hypotheses</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Given these three metrics, I created pairs of null and alternate
          hypotheses to predict what the results would be if we compared version
          A with version B.
        </p>
        <div class="three-up">
          <div>
            <h2><sup>01</sup> Misclick Rate</h2>
            <p>
              <b>H<sub>0</sub>:</b> There is no difference between the
              frequencies with which users click something else on the page
              before finding the correct button for the task in version A and
              version B.

              <br /><br />

              <b>H<sub>A</sub>:</b> There is a lower frequency with which users
              click something else on the page before finding the correct button
              for the task in version B than there is in version A.

              <br /><br />

              <b>Reasoning for H<sub>A</sub>:</b> The alternative hypothesis is
              based off of the design choice to make the “Make appointment”
              buttons bolder than the "See appointment" button to draw users'
              eye, so that users will misclick less often.

              <br /><br />

              <b>Prediction:</b> I predict that I will end up rejecting the null
              hypothesis, since the purpose of the redesign was to make things
              easier to find on the page; as such, this should make misclicking
              less likely to happen if the design was successful.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2><sup>02</sup> Time Spent on Page</h2>
            <p>
              <b>H<sub>0</sub>:</b> Users using version A spend the same amount
              of time on the webpage as those using version B.

              <br /><br />

              <b>H<sub>A</sub>:</b> Users using version A spend more time on the
              webpage than those using version B.

              <br /><br />

              <b>Reasoning for H<sub>A</sub>:</b> The alternative hypothesis is
              based off of the new structure of the page, with lines to break up
              the sections and different font sizes/colors that should bring
              more visual hierarchy into the page and make the user flow
              quicker.

              <br /><br />

              <b>Prediction:</b> I predict that I will end up rejecting the null
              hypothesis, since the point of the assignment was to make the
              entire page more efficient and easier to navigate; as such, this
              should make misclicking less likely to happen if the design was
              successful.

          <div>
            <h2><sup>03</sup> Mouse Movement</h2>
            <p>
              <b>H<sub>0</sub>:</b> Users using version A tend to move their
              cursor the same amount on the webpage as users using version B.

              <br /><br />

              <b>H<sub>A</sub>:</b> Users using version A tend to move their
              cursor a different amount on the webpage compared to users using
              version B.

              <br /><br />

              <b>Reasoning for H<sub>A</sub>:</b> The alternative hypothesis is
              based off of Version B’s more linear content structure and
              consistent but distinct style for different elements. Since the
              layouts differ, there’s no way to predict which results in less
              mouse movement, but we can still test to see if the layout changes
              the way people scan the page.

              <br /><br />

              <b>Prediction:</b> I predict that I will end up rejecting the null
              hypothesis since the new webpage should organize the information
              in a way that’s easier to scan, which should allow users to move
              their cursor around less before finding what they need to make the
              appointment.

      <h1><sup>04</sup> Statistical Analysis (Misclick Rate)</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For the misclick rate, I chose a chi<sup>2</sup> test with the two
          categories being “misclicked” and “didn’t misclick,” since we are
          really only measuring those two categories (based on true vs false)
          rather than measuring something on a continuous scale.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          After looking at the data, I fail to reject the null hypothesis
          because p > 0.05. We know this because our p-value is approximately
          0.775, which is much larger than our alpha of 0.05 and thus is not
          statistically significant. With a chi<sup>2</sup> value of about
          0.081, however, we can see that the order of magnitude in terms of the
          difference between the two samples is not too big. Lastly, our degrees
          of freedom (1) mainly comes from there being two categories and two
          samples that we compare.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h1><sup>05</sup> Statistical Analysis (Time Spent on Page)</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For time spent on page, I conducted a one-sided T test with A > B,
          since we only want to know if A > B, not if A != B, and our data is
          continuous.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="Initial sketches"
          src="media/Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 10.39.01 AM.png"
        />
        <p>
          After the analysis, I found statistically significant evidence that
          the alternative hypothesis is true because p <= 0.05. Our calculated
          p-value was approximately 0.001, which is much smaller than our alpha
          of 0.05 and is thus statistically significant. With a t-score of about
          -3.628, we can see that the order of magnitude in terms of the
          difference between the two samples is a sizable amount (though not
          extreme), and our degrees of freedom of about 22.880 comes from there
          being on average around 22-23 participants.

    <div class="section">
      <h1><sup>06</sup> Statistical Analysis (Mouse Movement)</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          For mouse movement, I performed a two-sided T test with A != B, since
          we’re only concerned with whether there’s a difference in mouse
          movement on a continuous scale, not necessarily with whether that
          difference is positive or negative.

        <p>
          After calculating our values, I found statistically significant
          evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true because p <= 0.05.
          Our calculated p-value was approximately 0.000, which is much smaller
          than our alpha of 0.05 and is thus statistically significant. With a
          t-score of about -4.221, we can see that the order of magnitude in
          terms of the difference between the two samples is a decent amount,
          and our degrees of freedom of around 22.896 comes from there being
          around 22-23 participants on average.

    <div class="section">
      <h1><sup>07</sup> Summary Statistics</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In general, my data was pretty varied, with the means for time on page
          comparing samples A/B to be around 22000/10000, the medians being
          20000/10000, and the ranges being 60000/7000; the means for mouse
          movement comparing samples B/A to be around 6471/2500, the medians
          being 5500/2000, and the ranges being 17000/1700.

          <br /><br />
          For both of the continuous categories (those just mentioned), B tended
          to have lower means and medians, suggesting that the process was sped
          up by the changes; however, this could also have been affected by the
          users’ experience in navigating the page by the time they used version
          B, since the volatility of the data (suggested by range) is much
          smaller. For the categorical data, the expected values of around 6/6
          for misclicks in samples A/B, as well as those of around 17/14 for
          those without misclicks, is pretty close to the actual results for
          those categories.

          <br /><br />
          Overall, I collected more data points for sample B (23) than sample A
          (20), but because there are only three more participants, it’s
          unlikely to make an extreme difference in the results.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A/B testing was a surprisingly interesting process, and I'm happy that
          I was able to try it since I had never done it before. Rather than
          just asking people directly for their (more subjective) opinion while
          using my page, as I usually do, it was nice to get a more objective
          view of their experience using data.
